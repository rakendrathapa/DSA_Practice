/**
 * PROBLEM NAME: Mutated Minions
 * Gru has not been in the limelight for a long time and is, therefore, planning something particularly nefarious.
 *
 * Frustrated by his minions' incapability which has kept him away from the limelight, he has built a transmogrifier — a machine which mutates minions.
 * Each minion has an intrinsic characteristic value (similar to our DNA), which is an integer.
 * The transmogrifier adds an integer K to each of the minions' characteristic value.
 * Gru knows that if the new characteristic value of a minion is divisible by 7, then it will have Wolverine-like mutations.
 * Given the initial characteristic integers of N minions, all of which are then transmogrified, find out how many of them become Wolverine-like.
 *
 * Input Format:
 * The first line contains one integer, T, which is the number of test cases. Each test case is then described in two lines.
 * The first line contains two integers N and K, as described in the statement.
 * The next line contains N integers, which denote the initial characteristic values for the minions.
 *
 * Output Format:
 * For each testcase, output one integer in a new line, which is the number of Wolverine-like minions after the transmogrification.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
 * 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
 * 1 ≤ K ≤ 100
 *
 * All initial characteristic values lie between 1 and 105, both inclusive.
 *
 * Example
 * Input:
 * 1
 * 5 10
 * 2 4 1 35 1
 *
 * Output:
 * 1
 *
 * Explanation:
 * After transmogrification, the characteristic values become {12,14,11,45,11}, out of which only 14 is divisible by 7. So only the second minion becomes Wolverine-like.
